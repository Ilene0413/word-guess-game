This game is a version of the game "Hangman."  All words to guess
are ice cream related.
There is a maximum of 10 words.
A player has a maximum of 14 guesses for letters not in the word, which is like creating a hangman with a head, 2 eyes, nose, mouth, body, 2 arms, 2 hands, 2 legs, and 2 feet.
A player hits any key on the keyboard to start the game.
The game will select a random word from the word list for the player to guess.
The game will keep count of the player's wins.
The game will keep track of the player's guesses and show the player the letters guessed. If a player presses the same letter more than once, it will only be counted as 1 guess.
If the letter guessed is in the word, it will show up on the screen where in the word it is.
The player guesses until the maximum number of guesses is allowed or the player guessed the word. 
When the game is over, a new picture will display based on the word that was guessed. If the player loses, melted ice cream is displayed.
The goal of the game is to guess the word in less than 14 times.
Pictures were taken from images doing google search and come from many different websites.
